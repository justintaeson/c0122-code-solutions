1. USERS CAN SIGN UP
- users can sign up by clicking on the Sign Up button which will trigger a hashchange event and change the state
- the state change will cause the page to re-render and show the sign up page
- once the user inputs a username and password to register, they'll click the Register button
- clicking the register button will have the client send a post request to the server
- if the username and pw are valid, it'll hash the password and send the login info to the database
- the server will respond to the client with a message to let them know the request was successful or not

2. USERS CAN LOGIN
- users will login and click on the sign in button
- the client will send a post request to the server
- as long as the username and pw are valid, the server will send a SQL query to find the login id and pw
- verify to see if the hashed pw in the data bases matches with the login pw
- the server will then respond with a token and user info
- this will cause a hashchange again which will re-render the page and because we're logged in, it'll show a Rick Roll gif

3. USERS CAN STAY SIGNED IN
- when the user refreshes the page, once the page renders, the app will check the token in localStorage
- if it's valid, it'll reset the state so that users will be signed in

4. USER CAN SIGN OUT
- when the user signs out, the app will remove the token
- the state will be set with users property to null
